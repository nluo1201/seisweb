She gets the sun in the daytime 
Perfume in the dusk 
And she comes out in the night time 
With the honeysuckle musk

Because she smells just like a rose 
And she tastes just like a peach 
She got me walking where the wildlife goes 
I’d do anything to reach her

And she was made in heaven 
Heaven’s in the world 
Is this just expresso love
You know I’m crazy for the girl

She call me just to talk 
She’s my lover, she’s a friend of mine 
She says hey mister you wanna take a walk 
In the wild west end sometime

And I get trouble with my breathing 
She says boys don’t know anything 
But I know what I want I want everything 
Well I feel so good cos I feel so good

And I feel so good cos it feels so right 
I was made to go with my girl 
Like a saxophone was made to go with the night

And she can raise one eyebrow 
Put her hand on my hip 
And I close one eye now 
Sweat on her lip

And I surrender to the fever 
She love me so tender
I got to believe her 
Love? Expresso love’s alright 
I don’t want no sugar in it

Thank you very much 
All wired up on it all fired up on it 
Expresso touch 
Hey maestro expresso 
It’s just another one just like the other one 
Hey maestro expresso 
Is this another one just like the other one
