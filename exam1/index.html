Romeo And Juliet	

A lovestruck Romeo sings a streetsusss serenade
Laying everybody low with a lovesong that he made
Finds a convenient streetlight steps out of the shade
Says something like you and me babe how about it?

Juliet says hey it’s Romeo you nearly gimme a heart attack
He’s underneath the window she’s singing hey la my boyfriend’s back
You shouldn’t come around here singing up at people like that
Anyway what you gonna do about it

Juliet the dice were loaded from the start
And I bet and you exploded in my heart
And I forget I forget the movie song
When you gonna realise it was just that the time was wrong Juliet?

Come up on different streets they both were streets of shame
Both dirty both mean yes and the dream was just the same
And I dreamed your dream for you and now your dream is real
How can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals?

When you can fall for chains of silver you can fall for chains of gold
You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold
You promised me everything you promised me thick and thin
Now you just says oh Romeo yeah you know I used to have a scene with him

Juliet when we made love you used to cry
You said I love you like the stars above I’ll love you till I die
There’s a place for us you know the movie song
When you gonna realise it was just that the time was wrong Juliet?

I can’t do the talk like they talk on TV
And I can’t do a love song like the way it’s meant to be
I can’t do everything but I’d do anything for you
I can’t do anything except be in love with you

And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be
All I do is keep the beat and bad company
All I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme
Julie I’d do the stars with you any time

Juliet when we made love you used to cry
You said I love you like the stars above I’ll love you till I die
There’s a place for us you know the movie song
When you gonna realise it was just that the time was wrong Juliet?

A lovestruck Romeo sings a streetsuss serenade
Laying everybody low with a lovesong that he made
Finds a convenient streetlight steps out of the shade
Says something like you and me babe how about it?



Expresso Love	

She gets the sun in the daytime 
Perfume in the dusk 
And she comes out in the night time 
With the honeysuckle musk

Because she smells just like a rose 
And she tastes just like a peach 
She got me walking where the wildlife goes 
I’d do anything to reach her

And she was made in heaven 
Heaven’s in the world 
Is this just expresso love
You know I’m crazy for the girl

She call me just to talk 
She’s my lover, she’s a friend of mine 
She says hey mister you wanna take a walk 
In the wild west end sometime

And I get trouble with my breathing 
She says boys don’t know anything 
But I know what I want I want everything 
Well I feel so good cos I feel so good

And I feel so good cos it feels so right 
I was made to go with my girl 
Like a saxophone was made to go with the night

And she can raise one eyebrow 
Put her hand on my hip 
And I close one eye now 
Sweat on her lip

And I surrender to the fever 
She love me so tender
I got to believe her 
Love? Expresso love’s alright 
I don’t want no sugar in it

Thank you very much 
All wired up on it all fired up on it 
Expresso touch 
Hey maestro expresso 
It’s just another one just like the other one 
Hey maestro expresso 
Is this another one just like the other one



Solid Rock	

Well take a look at that I made a castle in the sand
Saying this is where it’s at you know
Couldn’t understand now
If I realised that the chances were slim
How come I’m so surprised when the tide rolled in

I wanna live on solid rock
I’m gonna live on solid rock
I wanna give I don’t wanna be blocked
I’m gonna live on solid rock

Well I’m sick of potential I’m sick of vanity now
I’m sticking to essential reality now
I don’t know what’s worse
Try to make a silk purse
Living an illusion living in confusion

I wanna live on solid rock
I’m gonna live on solid rock
I wanna give I don’t wanna be blocked
I’m gonna live on solid rock

Well a house of cards
Was never built for shock
You could blow it down in any kind of weather
Now two solid rocks two solid blocks
You know they’re gonna stick
Yeah they’re gonna stick together

Because the heart that you break
That’s the one that you rely on
The bed that you make
That’s the one you gotta lie on
When you point your finger ‘cos your plan fell through
You got three more fingers pointing back at you

I wanna live on solid rock
I’m gonna live on solid rock
I wanna give I don’t wanna be blocked
I’m gonna live on solid rock I’m solid rock now
