<p>
A lovestruck Romeo sings a streetsusss serenade <br>
Laying everybody low with a lovesong that he made <br>
Finds a convenient streetlight steps out of the shade<br>
Says something like you and me babe how about it?<br>
</p>
</div>
<div class="verses">
<p>
Juliet says hey it’s Romeo you nearly gimme a heart attack<br>
He’s underneath the window she’s singing hey la my boyfriend’s back<br>
You shouldn’t come around here singing up at people like that<br>
Anyway what you gonna do about it<br>
</p>
</div>
<div class="verses">
<p>
Juliet the dice were loaded from the start<br>
And I bet and you exploded in my heart<br>
And I forget I forget the movie song<br>
When you gonna realise it was just that the time was wrong Juliet?<br>
</p>
</div>
<div class="verses">
<p>
Come up on different streets they both were streets of shame<br>
Both dirty both mean yes and the dream was just the same<br>
And I dreamed your dream for you and now your dream is real<br>
How can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals?<br>
</p>
</div>
<div class="verses">
<p>
When you can fall for chains of silver you can fall for chains of gold<br>
You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold<br>
You promised me everything you promised me thick and thin<br>
Now you just says oh Romeo yeah you know I used to have a scene with him<br>
</p>
</div>
<div class="verses">
<div class="chorus">
<p>
Juliet when we made love you used to cry<br>
You said I love you like the stars above I’ll love you till I die<br>
There’s a place for us you know the movie song<br>
When you gonna realise it was just that the time was wrong Juliet?<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="verses">
<p>
I can’t do the talk like they talk on TV<br>
And I can’t do a love song like the way it’s meant to be<br>
I can’t do everything but I’d do anything for you<br>
I can’t do anything except be in love with you<br>
</p>
</div>
<div class="verses">
<p>
And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be<br>
All I do is keep the beat and bad company<br>
All I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme<br>
Julie I’d do the stars with you any time<br>
</p>
</div>
